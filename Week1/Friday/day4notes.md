- Semantic tags vs div
  - Semantic tags make it easier to read: section, nav, header make more sense than just div
  - Robots/web scrapers can read semantic tags and improve SEO/rankings
  - Semantic tags help with screen readers and other assistive technologies, better for accessibility
  - Can't just make up your own tags - might work in chrome, but isn't supported in all browsers
